---

The Digital Transformation Agency's [ _Policy for the responsible use of AI in government_(Opens in a new tab/window)](https://www.digital.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2024-08/Policy%20for%20the%20responsible%20use%20of%20AI%20in%20government%20v1.1.pdf) sets out the Australian Government approach to embrace the opportunities of AI and provide for safe and responsible use of AI. 

The National Blood Authority (NBA) is committed to identifying ethical, responsible and meaningful use when considering the adoption of AI capabilities. We will be transparent as we explore, adopt and integrate AI technology to benefit staff and external stakeholders.

Currently, the NBA does not use AI in any services we provide. We are in the process of exploring the potential appropriate use of AI in the NBA context, the risks that will need to be managed, and the benefits it may bring. 

If the NBA implements any AI capability, this statement will be updated to outline our use including:

  * the intentions behind why the NBA is using AI or is considering its adoption
  * classification1 of AI use according to usage patterns and domains
  * classification1 of use where the public may directly interact with, or be significantly impacted by, AI without a human intermediary or intervention
  * measures to monitor the effectiveness of deployed AI systems, such as governance or processes
  * compliance with applicable legislation and regulation
  * efforts to identify and protect the public against negative impacts
  * compliance with each requirement under the [ _Policy for the responsible use of AI in government_(Opens in a new tab/window)](https://www.digital.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2024-08/Policy%20for%20the%20responsible%20use%20of%20AI%20in%20government%20v1.1.pdf)_._
