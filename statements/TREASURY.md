False

The [policy for the responsible use of AI in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy) provides mandatory requirements for departments and agencies relating to [accountable officials](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/accountable-officials), and [transparency statements](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/transparency-statements). This page provides details of the Treasury’s implementation of these policy requirements.

## Accountable Officials

The Treasury has designated the Chief Information Officer (CIO) as the accountable official for artificial intelligence (AI) use within the department.

## Intentions Behind AI Adoption

AI applications are used internally to support workplace productivity, with the aim over time to leverage AI to enhance our analytical capabilities, improve decision‑making processes, and increase operational efficiency.

## AI Use Cases

The Treasury participated in the Australian Government’s trial of a generative AI service, Microsoft 365 Copilot. The Treasury now continues to make Copilot available to trial participants, under the classification of workplace productivity. As a prerequisite to using Copilot, Treasury staff are required to complete internal training on the use of generative AI.

## Public Interaction with AI

The Treasury does not use AI in ways that the public may directly interact with or be significantly impacted by without human intervention.

## Monitoring Effectiveness

We have established robust processes, including regular reviews, audits, and staff training programs, to ensure the responsible and effective use of AI. These operate in tandem with broader Australian Government security policies, principles, minimum standards and common procedures in the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) and Information Security Manual (ISM)

## Training and Governance

Impacted staff will have access to training that aligns with the responsible and acceptable use of AI policies, and appropriate governance arrangements have been established to support AI within Treasury.

## Protecting Against Negative Impacts

We have established robust processes and proactive risk management strategies, including staff training programs, to ensure the responsible and effective use of AI. Our efforts are aligned with broader Australian Government security policies, principles, minimum standards, and common procedures as outlined in the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) and Information Security Manual (ISM).

The use of publicly available AI services is governed by our IT Acceptable Use Policy, Treasury’s Information Security Policy, and the [Policy for responsible use of AI in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy).

## Compliance with Legislation

The Treasury complies with all applicable legislation and regulations. We are committed to maintaining transparency and accountability in our AI practices through the AI transparency statement.

## Update Frequency

This transparency statement is reviewed and updated annually or whenever significant changes occur. The most recent update was on 28 February 2025.
