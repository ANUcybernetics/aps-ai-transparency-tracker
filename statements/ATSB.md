The Digital Transformation Agency's [ _Policy for the responsible use of AI in government_](https://www.digital.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2024-08/Policy%20for%20the%20responsible%20use%20of%20AI%20in%20government%20v1.1.pdf) sets out the Australian Government approach to embrace the opportunities of AI and provide for safe and responsible use of AI in the Australian Public Service. 

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) adheres to this policy supporting its principles under the "enable, engage, and evolve" framework. We will be transparent in our internal use of AI technology as we explore, evaluate and adopt AI technology to benefit our work and our stakeholders.

Currently, ATSB does not plan to use AI in services that the public may directly interact with or be significantly impacted by. If this changes, we will update this statement to detail our use of AI.

## **AI use**

Presently, the ATSB does not utilise AI to deliver any of its services. Although, the ATSB did participate in the Australian Government trial of Microsoft 365 Copilot.

## **Monitoring and governing AI use**

The ATSB is developing an overarching agency approach to AI and will establish an AI Steering Committee to assess the opportunities and risks in using AI within the agency. 

## **Accountable official**

The Chief Operating Officer is the accountable official for AI and is supported by Chief Information Officer to assist in guiding implementation of AI governance and monitoring current and emerging systems to ensure AI is used in a safe, ethical and effective way.

## **AI transparency statement**

This AI transparency statement was first published in March 2025. This statement will be reviewed annually, or when any significant change is made to our approach to AI.
