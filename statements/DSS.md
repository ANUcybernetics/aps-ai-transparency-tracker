# Artificial intelligence (AI) transparency statement

We adopt a whole of Australian Government approach to use AI safely and responsibly while embracing the opportunities AI provides. 

We follow the Digital Transformation Agency's [Policy for the responsible use of AI in government(Opens external website)](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy) (DTA Policy). Transparency is key to earning public trust and is an important aim of the DTA Policy and broader APS Reforms.

We recognise the benefits arising from safe and responsible use of AI systems. We are developing suitable governance and oversight to support future AI use and ensure alignment with the DTA Policy and other relevant policies and legislation.

We are currently exploring AI capabilities through two main initiatives: our participation in the GovAI program and the use of Microsoft Copilot via GovTEAMS.

## GovAI Program

This initiative gives us a chance to get hands-on experience with various AI tools in a secure, controlled setting. Our focus is on exploring how AI might boost productivity in our corporate and enabling functions, as well as enhance our policy development and data analytic capabilities.

## Microsoft Copilot via GovTEAMS

In addition to GovAI, we have authorised limited use of Microsoft Copilot through the GovTEAMS platform. This tool provides AI-assisted capabilities within the whole of government secure collaborative environment, further supporting our day-to-day operations and decision-making processes.

These initiatives are being undertaken with appropriate governance and oversight arrangements in place. Staff training on AI is a central consideration of these governance and oversight protocols. Training will be rolled out throughout the year to support staff participating in the AI initiatives and to build AI capability across our workforce. This includes leveraging resources and learning opportunities provided through the GovAI program.

We have appointed our Chief Information Officer (CIO) as our Accountable Official. This is consistent with the DTA Policy. The CIO is responsible for implementation of the DTA Policy and for leading on matters of AI within our department. 

We keep up to date with changes in the AI policy and governance environment and engage with whole-of-government capacity building initiatives, such as GovAI, to encourage APS-wide capability uplift over time.

While our use of AI is currently limited to controlled trials and exploration, we are committed to ensuring compliance with applicable legislation and regulations, and that any future use of AI is undertaken safely and responsibly. We will ensure:

  * AI use is appropriately governed
  * our engagement with AI is confident, safe and responsible
  * risks are identified and managed
  * AI access and usage is monitored
  * measures are implemented to monitor the effectiveness of deployed AI systems
  * efforts are made to protect the public against negative impacts.

Our AI Transparency Statement will be reviewed and updated annually or when we make a significant change to our approach to AI. This AI Transparency Statement was updated on 28 August 2025.
