## **Introduction**

The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) is committed to the safe, responsible, and transparent use of artificial intelligence (AI) in line with the Digital Transformation Agency’s (DTA) [Policy for the Responsible Use of AI in Government](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy).

AIHW provides trusted health and welfare data to support evidence-based decision-making for the benefit of all Australians. Our strategic goal of being an ‘innovative producer of datasets and analysis’ drives our approach to AI, ensuring it enhances the quality, accessibility, and reliability of our work.

The AIHW has adapted the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) definition of AI to the Institutes' work and considers that:

AI refers to machine-based systems that analyse data, generate insights, and support decision-making in health and welfare contexts. These systems infer patterns from structured and unstructured data to produce outputs such as predictions, classifications, recommendations, or automation of routine tasks, with varying levels of human oversight.

## **How AI is used at the AIHW**

AIHW uses AI, including machine learning (ML), to enhance our data analysis, improve operational efficiency and streamline internal processes. AI is applied as a tool to assist staff in the following areas:

  * Data analysis & insights - ML helps identify patterns, generate insights, and support predictive modelling for health and welfare indicators.
  * Data processing & quality assurance - ML is used to improve data linkage, protect against privacy breaches, assess data quality, and validate datasets.
  * Exploring generative AI - AIHW is trialling generative AI tools for internal applications such as content generation and summarisation (with human oversight). The use of generative AI follows strict security, privacy, and ethical guidelines.

AIHW does not use AI for service delivery decisions or any applications without human oversight. All AI-generated outputs are subject to human review to ensure accuracy, accountability, and compliance with ethical standards.

## **Governance, risk, and accountability**

AIHW ensures AI adoption is ethical, transparent, and accountable through robust governance mechanisms, including:

  * AI Accountable Official – An AIHW senior executive official responsible for AI oversight and monitoring compliance with government policies.
  * AI support and advice - AIHW has a dedicated artificial intelligence and machine learning team with an advisor for expert advice and helpdesk support.
  * AI risk assessment – AIHW is continuing to evolve its processes for evaluating risks associated with AI use as developments occur and new tools are brought forward.
  * AI guidelines & best practices – AIHW policies for managing privacy, security, ethics, and responsible data use cover the use of AI.
  * Data privacy & confidentiality – AI use must align with the AIHW’s overarching data governance framework, ensuring compliance with legislation, regulations and policies.
  * Training & capability building – AIHW provides staff with training on AI fundamentals, safe usage, and ethical considerations through internal and external learning programs.

## **Adherence to Government policies and regulations**

AIHW complies with all applicable legislation, regulations, frameworks, and policies, including: 

  * [Digital Transformation Agency’s (DTA) Policy for the Responsible Use of AI in Government](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy)
