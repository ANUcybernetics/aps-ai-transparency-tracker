# Reporting and Accountability

**▲**

As an accountable public agency, we are committed to transparency, accountability and compliance with legislation and Government policy.

##  Use of Artificial Intelligence Transparency Statement 

The Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (OIGIS) does not presently engage with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in performing our work. Our intent is to commence to explore the range of possibilities of its use within the Office in 2025 to drive innovation, improve corporate efficiency and support our workforce in developing and maintaining skills for a sustainable future.  
  
Within our operating environment, we are committed to ensuring that any future use of AI is appropriate for our business activities, is aligned to relevant legislative requirements and maintains human decision making and advice.

The statement below can also be downloaded [here](https://www.igis.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-02/OIGIS%20Use%20of%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20%28AI%29%20Transparency%20Statement.pdf).

##### Monitoring and Accountability

OIGIS has appointed the Executive Director, Enterprise Management Unit as OIGIS’ Chief AI Officer. As OIGIS explores the future use of AI in its work, OIGIS will develop and implement the appropriate frameworks to provide robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to ensure effectiveness, fairness and compliance with all government policies and requirements. As OIGIS further explores the use of AI, particular attention will be paid to ensuring any adaptation will align with legislation, ethical standards and public expectations.

##### How We Use AI

As a small agency, with national security considerations and limited resourcing, OIGIS has not yet commenced using any form of AI. As the OIGIS’ network is part of our MOU arrangement with our Portfolio Department we are reliant on tools available on that platform. As such we participate in discussions and forums with our Portfolio Department on the use of AI.

##### Usage Patterns

OIGIS does not currently employ the use of AI. As part of our initial considerations, we anticipate that if AI is used final decisions will still be made by a human to validate the outcomes generated by any AI system, and to maintain accountability and accuracy in the areas that may use the technology.

##### Domains

We are aware of the potential benefits and efficiencies that can be gained using AI in corporate and enabling functions which might optimise our small corporate resource allocation to improve simple administrative processes where possible. OIGIS’ use of AI will be contingent on assessment of the utility of the technology and availability on the platforms we intend to use which are supplied by our Portfolio Department.

##### Ensuring Responsible Use

Once OIGIS decides to proceed with any form of AI technology, and prior to deployment, we will ensure all staff who will use the technology will receive appropriate training, and that there will be an appropriate framework; with an OIGIS use of AI policy in place that aligns with Whole of Government requirements.

##  APS Census Results 

The Australian Public Service (APS) Employee Census is an annual survey of all staff, providing a platform to share their experiences and perspectives. The insights gathered help agencies understand workforce trends and inform actions across a wide range of areas, from leadership and capability to workplace culture, wellbeing and organisational performance. We publish our results and action plan to help increase public service transparency.

##  Emissions Reduction Plan 

The Australian Government released the [Net Zero in Government Operations Strategy](https://www.finance.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-11/Net_Zero_Government_Operations_Strategy.pdf) in November 2023, setting out the overall approach and action required by Commonwealth entities to achieve the [APS Net Zero 2030](https://www.finance.gov.au/government/climate-action-government-operations/aps-net-zero-emissions-2030) target.

The Net Zero in Government Operations Strategy represents a strong commitment by the Australian Government to lead by example on emissions reduction and contribute to the decarbonisation of Australia's economy.

The Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (OIGIS) is committed to the achievement of the Government's APS Net Zero 2030 target. The OIGIS is following the APS Net Zero 2030 target in full, as per the Net Zero in Government Operations Strategy.

Our Emissions Reduction Plan describes the priorities and actions OIGIS is taking to reduce our operational emissions and contribute to the APS Net Zero 2030 target. The full plan can be read [here](https://www.igis.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-03/OIGIS%20Emissions%20Reduction%20Plan.pdf).

##  Commonwealth Child Safe Framework Statement of Compliance 2025 

The Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS) is committed to the safety and wellbeing of children and to creating and maintaining a child safe organisation. The IGIS currently has no interactions with children in our day-to-day business; however, we recognise that it is the shared responsibility of all government agencies to prevent child exploitation and abuse. The IGIS has zero tolerance for child abuse and exploitation, and any allegations and concerns for the safety of children and young people will be treated most seriously. The IGIS is committed to the implementation of the National Principles for Child Safe Organisations, and compliance with the Commonwealth Child Safe Framework.

A risk assessment undertaken in 2025 rated the Office’s overall child safety risk as **LOW**. IGIS staff generally have no interaction with children; however, there may be very rare occasions where an IGIS officer works or engages directly with a child or children in the course of their duties. Such possible occasions include:

  * An IGIS officer has access to information about a child through normal inspection processes
  * an IGIS officer attends an ASIO interview of a minor undertaken under a questioning warrant issued pursuant to the __[_Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979_](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A02123/2013-06-29/text)
  * A person under the age of 18 applies for employment with IGIS
  * A person under the age of 18 makes a complaint to IGIS regarding an intelligence agency within IGIS jurisdiction, or
  * An IGIS officer delivers a presentation to university students, some of whom may be under the age of 18.

Where appropriate, the IGIS has mitigations in place to further reduce the risk to child safety. These mitigations include:

  * Multiple officers being present when an interaction is identified to involve a child, activity-specific risk assessments being completed when an activity is identified to involve a child, and officers receiving training on trauma-informed practices when relevant to their work.
  * IGIS officers in specific roles that may involve working or engaging with a child or children are to obtain a Working with Vulnerable People registration (Working with Children equivalent).

With these mitigations in place, the 2025 annual risk assessment identified that each of the IGIS’ activities pose a **LOW** or **VERY LOW** risk to child safety.

In 2023, the IGIS developed a child safety policy to provide guidance to staff regarding their obligations, relevant training, suitable mitigation strategies, and the approach to maintaining compliance.

The IGIS will continue to embed child safe initiatives into our culture and work practices, and will undertake an annual risk assessment to identify, evaluate, and manage any risk to child safety in IGIS activities.

##  Code of Conduct 

I, Christopher Jessup KC, Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, establish these procedures under subsection 15 (3) of the Public Service Act 1999 (Cth) (PS Act).

These procedures commence on the date this document was signed.  
Signed by: Christopher Jessup  
Date: 11 June 2024

##### **Application**

  1. These procedures must be complied with when determining:
     1. whether a person who is an Australian Public Service (APS) employee of the Office of the IGIS (OIGIS), or who is a former APS employee who was employed at the OIGIS at the time of the suspected misconduct, has breached the APS Code of Conduct (the Code) in section 13 of the PS Act; and
     2. any sanction/s to be imposed on a current OIGIS APS employee, in accordance with subsection 14(a), where a breach of the Code has been determined.  

  2. These procedures apply in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by a current or former OIGIS APS employee, or the actions of a current or former APS employee prior to commencing employment at the OIGIS, in respect of which a determination is to be made.  

  3. Not all suspected breaches of the Code may need to be dealt with by way of a determination. In particular circumstances, another way of addressing a suspected breach of the Code may be more appropriate.  

  4. In these procedures, a reference to a breach of the Code by a person includes a reference to a person engaging in conduct set out in subsection 15(2A) of the PS Act in connection with their engagement as an APS employee.  

  5. In these procedures, powers afforded to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS) under legislation (eg powers to suspend or reassign duties or determine a breach) may be delegated to other OIGIS employees. For information about delegations, this procedure should be read alongside the OIGIS’s Employee Administration Delegation.

##### **Availability of Procedures**

  6. These procedures are made publicly available on the IGIS website in accordance with subsection 15(7) of the PS Act.

##### **Breach decision-maker**

  7. The role of the breach decision-maker is to determine in writing whether a breach of the Code has occurred.  

  8. These procedures do not prevent the IGIS, or a person listed at clause 16 of these procedures, from appointing themselves as the breach decision-maker.  

  9. The breach decision-maker may undertake the investigation, or seek the assistance of an investigator, who may be external to the OIGIS. The investigator may investigate the alleged breach, gather evidence and make a report of recommended findings to the breach decision-maker.

##### **Sanction delegate**

  10. The delegate determining whether a sanction should be imposed for any breach of the Code is referred to in these procedures as the sanction delegate and will be the IGIS or hold a delegation of the power under subsection 15(1) of the PS Act.  

  11. These procedures do not prevent the breach decision-maker from being the sanction delegate in the same matter.

##### **Suspension delegate**

  12. The delegate determining whether an employee should be suspended from duties is referred to in these procedures as the suspension delegate and will be the IGIS or hold a delegation of the powers and functions under section 28 of the PS Act and section 14 of the Public Service Regulations 2023 (Cth) (PS Regulations).  

  13. Where suspension from duties is being considered, appointing a separate delegate from the breach decision-maker is preferable.

##### **Breach decision-maker and sanction delegate to be independent and unbiased**

  14. The IGIS or that employee taking action under clause 16 will take reasonable steps to ensure that:
     1. the person who determines whether a current or former OIGIS APS employee has breached the Code is, and appears to be, independent and unbiased; and
     2. the person who determines any sanction to be imposed is, and appears to be, independent and unbiased.  

  15. The breach decision-maker and sanction delegate must advise the IGIS or that employee taking action under clause 16 in writing if they consider that they may not be independent or unbiased or if they consider that they may reasonably be perceived not to be independent or unbiased; for example, if they are a witness in the matter.

##### **Decision to commence investigation**

  16. As soon as practicable after a suspected breach of the Code has been identified, the IGIS or one of the following OIGIS employees will consider if it is appropriate for a preliminary assessment to be conducted to assess whether the suspected breach of the Code should be formally investigated under these procedures:
     1. Deputy Inspector-General
     2. any Branch Head
     3. Executive Director, Enterprise Management Unit.  

  17. Once a decision is made to formally investigate the suspected breach under these procedures, the IGIS or that employee taking action under clause 16 will appoint a decision-maker (the ‘breach decision-maker’) to make a determination under these procedures.

##### **Reassignment of duties or suspension from duty**

  18. A current APS employee who is under investigation for a suspected breach of the Code may be:
     1. reassigned to alternative duties, either for a temporary period or on an ongoing basis, under section 25 of the PS Act; or
     2. suspended from duty by the suspension delegate under section 28 of the PS Act and section 14 of the PS Regulations.  

  19. In reassigning duties of a current APS employee who is under investigation, the suspension delegate will:
     1. notify the current APS employee who is under investigation of the proposal; and
     2. give the person a reasonable opportunity (usually, 14 calendar days) to respond before any decision to suspend is taken.  

  20. Sometimes urgent action may be required that will not allow for the notification and response as outlined at clause 19. In such cases, the suspension delegate may invite the current APS employee who is under investigation to comment after the decision has been made. Depending on their response, the suspension delegate has the flexibility to consider alternative arrangements, including suspension.  

  21. In suspending a current APS employee who is under investigation, the suspension delegate will:
     1. notify the current APS employee, in writing, of their preliminary intention to suspend them, and the reasons for this proposal; and
     2. give the person reasonable opportunity to respond (usually, 14 calendar days) before any decision to suspend is taken.  

  22. Sometimes urgent action may be required that will not allow for the notification and response outlined at clause 21. In such cases, the suspension delegate may invite the current APS employee who is under investigation to comment after the decision has been made.  

  23. To remove any doubt, clauses 18 to 22 also apply to SES employees.

##### **Breach determination process**

  24. The process for determining whether a current or former OIGIS APS employee has breached the Code must be carried out with as little formality, and as much expedition, as a proper consideration of the matter allows.  

  25. The process must be consistent with the principles of procedural fairness.  

  26. A determination may not be made in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by a current or former OIGIS APS employee unless reasonable steps have been taken to:
     1. inform the employee or former employee of:
        1. the details of the suspected breach (including any subsequent variation of those details); and
        2. in the case of a current OIGIS APS employee, the sanctions that may be imposed on the employee under subsection 15(1) of the PS Act; and
     2. give the employee or former employee a reasonable opportunity to make a statement in relation to each suspected breach (or subsequent variation to any initially suspected breach).  

  27. The statement referred to at clause 26(b) may be a written or oral statement and must be provided within 14 calendar days or any longer period that is allowed by the breach decision-maker.

##### **Variation in Investigation**

  28. If during the course of an investigation it becomes evident that there is a material variation in the nature or extent of the alleged breach notified to the employee, the employee must be notified in writing of the variation and any variation in the range of sanctions that may be imposed if the employee is found to have breached the Code of Conduct.  

  29. The employee must be provided with a reasonable opportunity (usually, 14 calendar days) to make a further statement or provide further evidence before a determination is made.

##### **Sanctions**

  30. The process for imposing a sanction must be consistent with the principles of procedural fairness.  

  31. If a determination is made that a current OIGIS APS employee has breached the Code, a sanction may not be imposed on the employee unless reasonable steps have been taken to:
     1. inform the employee of:
        1. the determination of a breach of the Code; and
        2. the sanction or sanctions that are under consideration in accordance with subsection 15(1) of the PS Act; and
        3. the factors that are under consideration in determining any sanction to be imposed; and
        4. give the employee a reasonable opportunity to make a statement in relation to each sanction/s under consideration.  

  32. The statement referred to at clause 31(a)(iv) may be a written or oral statement and must be provided within 14 calendar days or any longer period that is allowed by the sanction delegate.

##### **Record of determination and sanction**

  33. If a determination is made in relation to a suspected breach of the Code by a current or former OIGIS APS employee, a written record must be made of:
     1. the suspected breach;
     2. the determination;
     3. in the case of a current OIGIS APS employee, any sanctions imposed as a result of the determination that the employee breached the Code; and
     4. if a statement of reasons was given to the employee or former employee regarding the determination in relation to a suspected breach of the Code, or, in the case of a current employee, regarding the sanction decision, that statement of reasons or those statements of reasons.

##### **Additional procedural requirement for current OIGIS Senior Executive Service employees**

  34. If a current OIGIS Senior Executive Service (SES) employee is suspected of breaching the Code, the IGIS, or his delegate, must comply with the requirements at section 64 of the Australian Public Service Commissioner's Directions 2022 (Directions) to consult with the APS Commissioner, or a delegate of the APS Commissioner, for the purposes of this requirement:
     1. on the process for determining whether the employee has breached the Code; and
     2. if considering imposing a sanction, before imposing the sanction.

##### **Procedure when an employee seeks to move to another APS agency during investigation**

  35. If a current OIGIS APS employee seeks to move to another APS agency after they have been formally notified that they are suspected of breaching the Code but before the matter has been resolved, any move between APS agencies will generally be deferred, under subsections 42A(1) and 46(5) of the Directions, until:
     1. after a decision has been made about whether or not the employee has breached the Code; or
     2. it is decided that such a determination is not necessary.

##### **Review**

  36. Where a determination has been made that a non-SES OIGIS APS employee has breached the Code, they may be eligible to seek a review of the action under section 33 of the PS Act. A review may also be sought in respect of a sanction decision, unless the sanction was termination of employment.  

  37. Applications for review shall be made to the Merit Protection Commission directly. The Fair Work Act 2009 provides a review process for termination of employment.
