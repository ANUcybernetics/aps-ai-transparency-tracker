The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) recognises the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance efficiency, improve decision-making, and service delivery. In adopting AI technologies, PM&C is committed to upholding the highest **transparency, risk management, and governance** standards to ensure responsible and ethical use.

## Our approach to AI transparency

  * **Accountability and Oversight** —PM&C's AI systems are subject to robust governance frameworks, ensuring alignment with legal, ethical, and policy obligations.
  * **Explainability and Fairness** —We use AI models that are interpretable, fair, and free from bias, with clear explanations available for decisions made using AI.
  * **Privacy and Security** —Protecting personal data is paramount. AI applications comply with strict privacy and cybersecurity standards to safeguard sensitive information.
  * **Human Oversight and Decision-Making** —AI assists, not replaces, human judgment. Critical decisions remain under human supervision, with mechanisms in place for review.
  * **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement** —AI systems are assessed for performance, fairness and transparency.

PM&C adheres to [ _Australia’s AI Ethics Principles_](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/australias-artificial-intelligence-ethics-principles) _,_ demonstrating our commitment to protecting privacy and security and to the Digital Information Agency’s [ _Policy for the responsible use of AI in government._](https://www.digital.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2024-08/Policy%20for%20the%20responsible%20use%20of%20AI%20in%20government%20v1.1.pdf) AI must be used in a manner consistent with the [APS Values, Code of Conduct and Employment Principles.](https://www.apsc.gov.au/working-aps/integrity/integrity-resources/aps-values-code-conduct-and-employment-principles)

In addition to Australia’s AI Ethics Principles, PM&C has adopted the following 6 AI principles: 

  1. Only AI tools that are authorised for access and use within PM&C are to be deployed.
  2. Users must critically examine AI outputs and ensure they can justify their decisions.
  3. AI input must not include or reveal classified, sensitive, or personal information.
  4. AI must not be the final decision-maker on government advice and services.
  5. AI must be used in a manner consistent with the APS Values, Employment Principals and Code of Conduct.
  6. PM&C will not use AI in any way that members of the public may directly interact with, or be significantly impacted by, without a human intermediary or intervention.

PM&C provides guidance to staff, including training in AI government fundamentals, to help understand the compliance and governance arrangements and the requirement to adhere to both internal and external policies.

PM&C is dedicated to fostering public trust by ensuring AI-driven processes remain **ethical, responsible, and aligned with the interests of the Australian Government** while still being able to harness AI technologies.

This statement will be reviewed annually, when PM&C makes significant changes to our approach to AI, or when any new factor impacts this statement.
