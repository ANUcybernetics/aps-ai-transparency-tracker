# Artificial Intelligence (AI) transparency statement

Published date

28 February 2025

Professional Services Review (PSR) is adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) in ways that are safe, ethical and responsible. PSR’s approach to adopting AI is most influenced by the opportunities to enhance workplace productivity.

PSR is engaging with AI according to Australia’s AI Ethics principles emphasising privacy protection and security, transparency and explainability, and accountability and is consistent with the Policy for the responsible use of AI in government.

## Monitoring and accountability

PSR’s General Manager (GM), designated as the Accountable Officer (AO) for AI, is charged with implementing the Policy for the responsible use of AI in government across PSR. The COO is a member of PSR’s Executive Management Team (EMT) which has oversight of all PSR governance decisions and frameworks.

The EMT has identified AI as an emerging risk but does not disregard its potential for improving operational processes and reporting that may inform and gain insights when applied responsibly. The EMT is monitoring the adoption of AI consistent with internal policies such as ‘Acceptable Use of ICT Resources’ which expressly prohibits PSR from using sensitive or personal information on open web-based generative AI platforms as well as relevant government legislation, regulations, policies and official guidance including secrecy provisions of the _Health Insurance Act 1973_. The adoption of AI in PSR will be supported by training.

## How we use AI

PSR uses AI that complements and improves on operational efficiency while keeping a human in the loop. PSR is considering AI usage in a longer-term timeframe with specific regard to:

  * opportunities to automate internal business enabling processes and increase efficiency
  * the use of AI for managing and viewing medical records, and how PSR processesand technologies need to adapt to take account of this during a review.

## Usage Patterns

PSR uses AI for workplace productivity. Any content created using generative AI is to facilitate and enhance internal communications.

PSR does not use AI for any of its statutory functions administering the PSR Scheme under Part VAA of the _Health Insurance Act 1973._ Decision-making within this framework is not open to machine-based inferences or unqualified interpretations. The decision makers at each stage of the PSR Scheme are experienced medical practitioners, who apply their knowledge and experience as health professionals to make highly complex and evaluative decisions. The level of risk is such that decisions under the PSR Scheme are not appropriate for AI or automated decision making.

## Domains

PSR currently applies its use of AI within Corporate and Enabling functions for internal communications.
