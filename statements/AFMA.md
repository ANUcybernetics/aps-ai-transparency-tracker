# Artificial Intelligence Transparency Statement

On this page

The [policy for the responsible use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy) provides mandatory requirements for departments and agencies relating to [accountable officials](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/accountable-officials), and [transparency statements](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/transparency-statements). This page provides details of AFMA’s implementation of these policy requirements. 

## Accountable Official 

AFMA has appointed its Chief Information Officer to the role of AI Accountable Official and they are responsible for implementing the policy within AFMA. 

## AFMA’s approach to AI adoption and use 

We will be transparent as we evolve and adapt to changes in AI technology and policy requirements. 

We have processes to ensure:

  * our AI use is appropriately governed
  * our engagement with AI is confident, safe and responsible
  * our risks are identified and addressed, and
  * our AI access and usage is monitored. 

We do not use AI in compliance, auditing or decision-making processes without human oversight. 

AFMA currently uses AI to enhance workplace productivity and support corporate and enabling functions. These applications focus on streamlining internal processes and automating routine tasks. 

We are investigating the use of AI as part of our [Data Transformation and Electronic Monitoring Program](https://www.afma.gov.au/monitoring-tools/electronic-monitoring-program/data-transformation-and-electronic-monitoring). 

For further information or enquiries about AFMA’s adoption of AI, you can contact us directly at [info@afma.gov.au](mailto:info@afma.gov.au). 

 _This statement will be reviewed annually when we make a significant change to our approach to AI, or when any new factor impacts this statement._
