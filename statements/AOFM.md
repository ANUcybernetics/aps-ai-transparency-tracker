title: Artificial Intelligence Transparency Statement | AOFM
---

The Australian Office of Financial Management is engaging with artificial intelligence (AI) in a way that allows us to discover and adapt to new opportunities and practices, while keeping humans at the centre of our decision-making.

Our intention is to leverage AI to drive innovation, improve operational efficiency, and support the broader goal of managing the government’s debt portfolio.

## **How we use AI**

We currently use AI to assist in workplace productivity. 

These applications focus on streamlining processes, automating routine tasks and demonstrating best-practice approaches. 

## **Usage patterns and domains**

The AOFM does not currently use AI in service delivery. AI is not used in compliance, auditing or decision-making without having a human-in-the-loop.

## **Ensuring responsible use**

The AOFM receives information and communication technology (ICT) services from the Department of Treasury.

We operate within the constraints of the Treasury ICT environment, including governance and policies around the acceptable use of AI.

Internally, the AOFM Operations Committee has oversight of the use of AI products within the agency. 

## **Protecting the public against negative impacts**

The AOFM has safeguards in place to mitigate risks and support responsible use of AI. The AOFM publishes an annual AI Transparency Statement to provide visibility on how we use and manage AI within our agency.

## **Compliance with the policy for the responsible use of AI in government**

The AOFM has gained compliance with the Policy by nominating an accountable official to the Digital Transformation Agency and by releasing this Statement.

This Statement was last updated in February 2025. 

## **Updating the Statement**

The AOFM’s Statement will be reviewed and updated at the earliest of these junctures:

  * 28 February 2026

  * when making a significant change to our approach to AI, or

  * when any new factor materially impacts the existing statement’s accuracy.
