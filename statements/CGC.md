The [policy for the responsible use of AI in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy) provides mandatory requirements for departments and agencies relating to [accountable officials](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/accountable-officials), and [transparency statements](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/transparency-statements). This page provides details of the CGC’s implementation of these policy requirements.

### Accountable Officials

The CGC has designated the Chief Operating Officer as the accountable official for artificial intelligence (AI) use within the agency.

### Intentions Behind AI Adoption

AI applications are used internally to support workplace productivity, with the aim over time to leverage AI to enhance our analytical capabilities, improve decision‑making processes, and increase operational efficiency.

### Public Interaction with AI

The CGC does not use AI in ways that the public may directly interact with or be significantly impacted by without human intervention.

### Monitoring Effectiveness

We have established robust processes, including regular reviews, audits, and staff training programs, to ensure the responsible and effective use of AI. These operate in tandem with broader Australian Government security policies, principles, minimum standards and common procedures in the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) and Information Security Manual (ISM)

### Training and Governance

Impacted staff will have access to training that aligns with the responsible and acceptable use of AI policies, and appropriate governance arrangements have been established to support AI within the CGC.

### Protecting Against Negative Impacts

We have established robust processes and proactive risk management strategies, including staff training programs, to ensure the responsible and effective use of AI. Our efforts are aligned with broader Australian Government security policies, principles, minimum standards, and common procedures as outlined in the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) and Information Security Manual (ISM).

The use of publicly available AI services is governed by the Department of Treasury's IT Acceptable Use Policy and Information Security Policy, and the [Policy for responsible use of AI in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy).

### Compliance with Legislation

The CGC complies with all applicable legislation and regulations. We are committed to maintaining transparency and accountability in our AI practices through the AI Transparency Statement.

### Update Frequency

This transparency statement is reviewed and updated annually or whenever significant changes occur.
