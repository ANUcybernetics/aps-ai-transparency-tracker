## Artificial Intelligence Transparency Statement

In accordance with the Digital Transformation Agency’s (DTA) [Policy for responsible use of AI in government(Opens in a new tab/window)](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy), this page provides the Climate Change Authority’s statement on the adoption and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The Authority’s commitment to digital innovation aligns with the Australian Government’s [Data and Digital Government Strategy(Opens in a new tab/window)](https://www.dataanddigital.gov.au/strategy/missions/government-for-the-future#adopt_emerging_technologies) (see _adopting emerging technologies_).

When referring to AI, the Authority applies the [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development(Opens in a new tab/window)](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/explanatory-memorandum-on-the-updated-oecd-definition-of-an-ai-system_623da898-en) definition:

_"a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments. Different AI systems vary in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment_.”

### Accountable Official

The Authority’s Corporate General Manager and Chief Security Officer was designated as the accountable official for the Authority under the _Policy for the responsible use of AI in government_ on 28 November 2024. 

### How we use AI

At this time, the Authority has not adopted any specific AI applications in its operations and has taken steps to ensure that any staff using public generative AI tools do so in accordance with applicable whole of government requirements and expectations. The Authority sees potential benefits from the adoption of AI in the future and is looking for opportunities to do so safely and responsibly. The Authority, in consultation with the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (as the Authority’s ICT provider), will explore the potential for AI to be used by our staff within the constraints applicable to our ICT systems. 

### Public interaction and impact

The Authority is committed to ensuring that the use of AI has a positive impact on the environment and public. Any future decisions or outcomes generated by AI that could affect the public or environment will involve human oversight or intervention to ensure fairness and accountability.

### Compliance

We comply with all mandatory requirements of the _Policy for responsible use of AI in government_. We will regularly review our compliance as a part of existing governance, and risk management processes. 

This transparency statement was made in February 2025. In line with the _Policy for responsible use of AI in government_ it will be updated if our approach to AI changes, and at least every twelve months
