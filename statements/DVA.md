This statement sets out the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) approach to the safe, responsible and ethical adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in accordance with the Digital Transformation Agency’s (DTA) [Policy for the responsible use of AI in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2024-08/Policy for the responsible use of AI in government v1.1.pdf).

## Our Approach to AI

At DVA, we are dedicated to modernising our technology systems to ensure veterans and their families have timely access to support and services. This includes identifying opportunities to enhance and automate through the application of technology, including safe and responsible use of AI to improve our processes, modernise our digital services, and drive improvements and innovations that ensure we provide a connected and accessible veteran support system.

AI is a fast-changing technology set that has great potential to improve operations and enhance services provided by the department. It is a transformative technology that we will engage with carefully and transparently as we explore how we can safely and ethically use it to improve outcomes for the veteran community.

We are committed to transparently working with veterans on how AI could be used to better support their needs. We are also committed to engaging with our employees.

## Robust AI Governance

DVA is finalising an AI Policy that incorporates the principles, approach to risk management, and approval considerations to help guide our investigation, evaluation and implementation of AI, including our adoption of suitable, robust AI governance. We will continue to be guided by Australian Government policies, frameworks and guidelines around AI as well as industry best-practice.

As per the DTA’s [Policy for the Responsible use of AI in Government](https://www.digital.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2024-08/Policy for the responsible use of AI in government v1.1.pdf), DVA will ensure:

  * AI use is appropriately governed
  * engagement with AI is confident, safe and responsible, and promotes accountability and transparency
  * stakeholders, particularly the veteran community, have trust in our use of AI
  * risks are identified and addressed with appropriate mitigation measures
  * AI access and usage is monitored.

DVA has stood up an AI Advisory Board, which includes Australian Government representatives, technical experts and a representative from veterans’ welfare and advocacy community organisations. The Advisory Board will help us ensure there is proper consultation with the veteran community in consideration and adoption of AI. Additionally, the Advisory Board will provide advice on AI safety and security, and will be consulted on AI initiatives, as well as on the preparation and maintenance of this transparency statement.

DVA is exploring opportunities where AI can help to achieve positive outcomes for veterans and veteran families. Ongoing engagement and consultation with the veteran community is essential to ensure improved outcomes and improved services.

DVA is committed to building trust with the veteran community, and we are dedicated to transparently designing and driving improvement initiatives through consultation with veterans, their families and their advocates.

When new proposals on AI are considered, DVA will engage with the veteran community via established communication and consultation mechanisms, such as, but not limited to:

  * DVA website
  * Social media
  * Vetaffairs
  * Defence Publications & Transition seminars
  * Advocacy Training and Development Program (ATDP) newsroom articles 
  * Deputy Commissioner mailing lists (State Ex Service Organisations (ESOs) and fee-for-service advocates) 
  * National Consultation Framework (National ESOs) comprising 
    * Ex-Service Organisation Round Table (ESORT) 
    * Female Veterans Families Forum (FVFF)
    * National Aged and Community Care Forum (NACCF) 
    * Operational Working Party (OWP)
    * Younger Veterans - Contemporary Needs Forum (YVF).

## Adoption of AI in DVA

DVA adopts the [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) definition](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/explanatory-memorandum-on-the-updated-oecd-definition-of-an-ai-system_623da898-en.html) in our consideration and discussion of AI.

> An AI system is a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments. Different AI systems vary in their autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment.

AI at DVA is used primarily in analytics for insights across **service delivery** and **corporate and enabling** domains, although this is evolving.

DVA will monitor usage to assure ongoing suitability of these technologies for these purposes. For more information about the usage of AI in government and the domains in which they apply, please see [http://digital.gov.au/ai/resources/use-classification](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/resources/use-classification).

The department currently has AI technology deployed for:

  * Statistical modelling and horizon scanning – this includes AI technology (Machine Learning algorithms) to support maintenance and enhancement of data modelling.
  * Improving writing clarity – AI tool(s) support checking of spelling, grammar and punctuation.
  * AI-enabled website search on the DVA website, to improve access to publicly available information. The search function only has access to publicly available information.

DVA is also testing and trialling AI tools.

  * A trial of Microsoft Copilot is underway, consistent with trials by other Australian Government Departments.
  * DVA is accessing the Commonwealth whole of government GovAI environment, including to evaluate potential AI tools, which may support DVA employees to speed up claims processing. Current testing on the GovAI technology platform does not use veteran personal data.
  * DVA is trialling an AI tool CLIKChat to help staff quickly find and summarise information from our external websites (Consolidated Library of Information and Knowledge, Department of Veterans Affairs and Repatriation Medical Authority). CLIKChat uses publicly available information, it does not access veteran records or personal data. It does not make decisions or give recommendations. All information from CLIKChat is checked by staff with human judgement always in control.

DVA also expects the underpinning technology in our digital ecosystem to become increasingly sophisticated, including by leveraging AI.

Periodic updates will be made to this statement to report on progress.

## Simpler forms of basic computer validation and task automation

As the community would expect, DVA computer systems support employees and decision-makers with basic validation and task management, which can include some basic automation. These types of activities are governed by other arrangements and are outside the scope of the [Policy for the responsible use of AI in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2024-08/Policy for the responsible use of AI in government v1.1.pdf).

DVA **does** make use of basic computer-assisted task management to support the efficiency of its service delivery and decision-making processes in line with general principles of administrative decision-making.

DVA **does not** and **will not** use AI to make decisions without appropriate human oversight - ‘human in the loop’ is a guiding principle.

## Compliance

As part of our adoption of AI technology, we are ensuring compliance with all relevant legislation, including the _Archives Act 1983_ (Cth), _Freedom of Information Act 1982_ (Cth), and the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth), [DVA’s Privacy Policy](https://www.dva.gov.au/about-us/privacy-and-legal-resources/privacy/dva-privacy-policy "DVA Privacy Policy"), and compliance with relevant Veterans’ Affairs law. 

For more information about the laws relevant to support for veterans and their families, please visit [our website](https://www.dva.gov.au/access-benefits/compensation-claims/laws-cover-claims "Laws that cover claims"). For additional detail about all legislation administered by the department, please visit the [Federal Register of Legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.au/). 

The department is compliant with the mandatory requirements of the [Policy for the responsible use of AI in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2024-08/Policy for the responsible use of AI in government v1.1.pdf): 

  * A DVA AI Accountable Official was designated in October 2024.
  * This AI Transparency Statement was first published on dva.gov.au in February 2025. 

We will be reviewing and updating this statement annually or when significant changes occur within our adoption of AI technology.
