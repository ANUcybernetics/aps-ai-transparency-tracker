# AI Transparency Statement

* * *

Comcare acknowledges the Digital Transformation Agency’s [Policy for the responsible use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy) (the Policy) that sets the approach for the use of AI by government.

While the Policy is not a mandatory requirement for Comcare, we are committed to the safe, ethical and responsible use of AI. Comcare believes transparency is critical to building public trust.

Comcare at present does not use AI for any of its core functions or responsibilities. Specifically, AI is not used in compliance, auditing, or decision-making processes without human oversight. This means that while AI technologies may be used to assist in various tasks, any final decisions or actions are made by a human. This approach ensures that there is always a human responsible for accountability and accuracy in service delivery. Comcare staff are not permitted to input sensitive information of its employees or customers into AI technologies.

Comcare sees benefits from using AI to improve the analysis and communication of information flows and in improving workplace productivity. We are committed to safe, ethical, and responsible AI use, guided by:

  * existing information security, privacy, and risk management frameworks
  * alignment with Australia’s Voluntary AI Safety Standard and AI Ethics Principles
  * mandatory staff training on AI fundamentals, privacy, data analytics, and cybersecurity
  * additional training for employees involved in AI procurement, development, and deployment
  * strict compliance with relevant legislation, frameworks, and policies
  * active monitoring of AI usage to ensure continued security and compliance.

This statement has been published in February 2025 and will be reviewed annually, or earlier if Comcare’s adoption of AI changes.
