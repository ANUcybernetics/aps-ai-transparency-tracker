27 February 2025

The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is dedicated to the adoption and responsible use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This Transparency Statement outlines our approach to AI use within the NHMRC, in accordance with the DTA's [policy for responsible AI in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy).

## Purpose of AI Use

The NHMRC encourages the use of AI to achieve productivity where it is ethical and safe to do so. Our AI initiatives include automation of repeatable processes which helps us streamline our work to support the overall mission of building a healthy Australia.

AI is not relied upon for decision-making in NHMRC.

## AI Applications

Currently, the NHMRC primarily uses Microsoft’s Copilot as its AI tool. Copilot allows staff to apply AI for the purposes of:

  * **Automation and Efficiency** \- AI automates repetitive tasks (for example, meeting transcriptions, minute, searching for emails or sorting data), allowing staff to focus on more complex and value-added activities.
  * **Office Productivity** \- AI is employed to enhance textual interpretation and generation by understanding and responding in natural language, such as structuring text in documents or summarising written material.

## Monitoring and Governance

The NHMRC has established governance mechanisms to ensure the ethical and effective use of AI. This includes:

  * **Training:** All staff using Copilot complete AI training to ensure that there is always human involvement for any processes where AI is applied. 
  * **Community of Practice** : An inclusive group that meets regularly to discuss AI-related risks and opportunities.
  * **Governance Forums:** We use our range of existing forums integrating AI issues such as security and privacy.

## Public Impact and Compliance

We are committed to protecting the public from potential negative impacts of AI. We will assess AI use cases where the public may directly interact with or be significantly impacted by AI. We will use the DTA’s [AI assurance framework](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/pilot-ai-assurance-framework) to review the impact of AI against [Australia's AI ethics principles](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/accountability-and-reporting/Australia&apos;s%20AI%20ethics%20principles). The NHMRC will also adhere to any relevant legislation and regulations governing AI across Commonwealth agencies, such as the DTA's [policy for responsible AI in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy).

## Transparency and Updates

This Transparency Statement is part of our commitment to open and transparent communication about our AI use. It will be updated regularly to reflect any changes in our AI practices and policies.
