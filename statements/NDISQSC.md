title: Artificial intelligence (AI) transparency statement | NDIS Quality and Safeguards
  Commission
---

**February 2025**

The Digital Transformation Agency's [Policy for the responsible use of AI in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2024-08/Policy%20for%20the%20responsible%20use%20of%20AI%20in%20government%20v1.1.pdf) (the Policy) sets out the Australian Government’s approach to embracing the opportunities of AI while ensuring that use is safe and responsible. Transparency is critical to building public trust and is an important aim of the Policy and the broader APS Reform agenda.

An AI system is a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments. Different AI systems vary in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment.

Currently, the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission (NDIS Commission) does not use AI in services or advice we provide externally (publicly) or internally.

When the NDIS Commission implements AI capability, we will update this statement in accordance with the Policy. This statement will also be reviewed annually, when we make a significant change to our approach to AI, or when any new factor impacts this statement.
