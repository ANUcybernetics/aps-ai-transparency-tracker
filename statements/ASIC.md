#  Artificial intelligence transparency statement 

ASIC’s Artificial intelligence (AI) transparency statement is issued further to the Australian Government’s [Policy for the responsible use of AI in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy "Australian Government's Policy for the responsible use of AI in government") (the policy). The policy provides mandatory requirements for [accountable officials](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/accountable-officials "Accountable officials") of government departments and agencies, and their [](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/accountable-officials)[transparency statements](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/transparency-statements "Transparency statements"). This page provides details of ASIC’s implementation of those requirements.

ASIC is Australia’s integrated corporate, financial services, consumer credit and markets regulator. ASIC’s work helps maintain the integrity of Australia’s financial system and protects consumers from harm. We do this by undertaking a range of regulatory activities that will be improved by developing and deploying AI systems.

ASIC is committed to safe, responsible, and transparent use of AI and will comply with applicable laws and regulation.

## Why ASIC uses AI or is considering its adoption

ASIC has an extensive remit, and AI can make us more effective and efficient. Given the rapid adoption of AI in financial services, our ability to regulate the use of AI in this sector will also be enhanced by gaining expertise in and experience with AI.

## Classification of AI use according to usage patterns and domains

ASIC has adopted the definition of AI used in the policy. This definition is broad and potentially includes technologies and systems not commonly considered as AI. We manage AI systems by taking a risk-based approach. For example, we scrutinise more closely and apply tighter controls to AI systems that present the most risk.

As a law-enforcement agency, there may be occasions when we do not disclose the use of AI in connection with surveillance and enforcement activity, and this transparency statement should be read subject to that qualification.

The following tables describe how ASIC is currently using AI, as prescribed by the Digital Transformation Agency:

The table below demonstrates AI usage and patterns at ASIC.

**Usage pattern** | **Description**  
---|---  
Analytics for insights |  Identifies patterns, produces insights, and extracts information within structured and unstructured data  
Workplace productivity |  Automates routine tasks and helps manage workflows  
Decision making and administrative action |  Supports decision making by guiding, assessing, or by making a recommendation to a human decision maker  
Image processing |  Identifies patterns and objects within images (such as nudity) to prevent exposure of ASIC staff to inappropriate material  
  
The table below demonstrates ASIC domains where AI is used at ASIC.

**Domain** | **Description**  
---|---  
Compliance and fraud detection |  Supports identification and summarisation of patterns and anomalies in data to detect fraudulent activities and risk  
Corporate and enabling |  Supports corporate functions by automating processes, optimising resource allocation, and improving operational efficiency  
Law enforcement, intelligence, and security |  Supports enforcement and intelligence activities by analysing data from various sources, and by aiding in intelligence gathering  
Service delivery |  Enhances efficiency of internal services  
  
## Classification of use where the public may directly interact with, or be significantly impacted by AI, without a human intermediary or intervention

ASIC does not use AI in any manner that allows direct interaction with the public or significantly impacts the public, without human oversight or involvement.

## Measures to monitor the effectiveness of deployed AI systems, such as governance or processes

ASIC currently has governance structures in place and is developing others. We are also building workforce capability. For example:

### ASIC’s AI policy

Our AI policy sets organisational responsibilities and considerations for developing, deploying, and using AI. Our AI policy is aligned with the principles underpinning the [Australian AI Ethics Principles](https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/australias-artificial-intelligence-ethics-principles/australias-ai-ethics-principles) and implements the [Australian Government’s Policy for the responsible use of AI in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy).

### Our AI assurance framework

We are participating in whole-of-government initiatives to develop an AI assurance framework comprising AI controls, measurement and assessment, monitoring and reporting, roles and responsibilities.

### AI board

An AI board oversees the design, development, deployment and use of AI by ASIC.

### Foundational technologies

We are investigating and adopting fit-for purpose technology to support the use of AI. This has involved:

  * regular monitoring and evaluation of performance,
  * adoption of robust security measures and access control, including monitoring for abnormal security activities, and
  * implementation of explainable AI methods to ensure the AI systems are interpretable, explainable and understandable.

### People capabilities

We are implementing role-based training programs for AI. We have also developed a series of organisation-wide AI training sessions to address our immediate needs. Data literacy is also a core capability within ASIC’s learning and development syllabus.

## Efforts to identify and protect the public against negative impacts of AI

For our regulatory and enforcement activities, ASIC uses well-understood systems that have clear and proven benefits. Our risk-based approach is aligned to the Australian Government AI Assurance Framework.

AI systems developed by our data analytics teams and procured from external partners are used within ASIC. These are described under the usage patterns and domains section of this statement. ASIC’s data and AI governance practices include privacy, ethics, and security assessments. In all cases of AI use, human review or oversight is involved before any action is taken.

## Accountable official

ASIC’s Senior Executive Leader, Data, Analytics and AI is the accountable official under the policy.
