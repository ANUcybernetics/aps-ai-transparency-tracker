# Artificial Intelligence (AI) transparency statement

## **Introduction**  

At Defence Housing Australia (DHA), we are committed to the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance our services and operations while ensuring transparency, accountability, and the protection of privacy. This AI Transparency Statement outlines DHAs approach to integrating AI technologies and how DHA will prioritise fairness, security, and transparency in all AI-driven initiatives.  

## **Initiatives**

DHA recognises the unique characteristics of AI systems means traditional governance approaches may not be appropriate. Therefore, DHA has committed to an AI Program of work to lay the foundations for AI readiness, compliance and benefits realisation.   

DHA’s AI Initiatives will focus on continued improvements to our customers’ experience, through data driven decisions, remaining human centred and staying connected, coordinated and committed as we navigate the continually changing AI landscape. 

### 1\. Purpose of AI Use

DHA will continue to investigate how AI can be used to improve decision-making, enhance customer experiences, streamline operations, and support the effective delivery of housing solutions to defence personnel and their families. AI systems will be designed to complement human decision-making, ensuring better outcomes for our stakeholders.

### 2\. Transparency and Communication

DHA strives to ensure that our stakeholders are fully informed about the role of AI in our processes. We will clearly communicate when AI is used in a decision-making process, especially when it impacts our employees, customers, partners, or the broader community. 

### 3\. Ethical Use of AI

DHA is committed to the ethical development and deployment of AI technologies. We will adhere to strict ethical principles that emphasise fairness, non-discrimination, and the avoidance of bias in all AI-driven activities. We will continuously monitor and audit AI models to ensure they operate in line with these principles. DHA will be guided by the Australian Government’s, "Australia's AI Ethics Principles".  

### 4\. Privacy and Data Protection

The use of AI at DHA will comply with Australian privacy laws and regulations. DHA takes the protection of personal data seriously and will ensure that AI systems are designed with data privacy and security at their core. DHA has blocked DeepSeek AI to meet the Department of Home Affairs Protective Security Policy Framework compliance. 

### 5\. Accountability and Oversight

DHA will be guided by the Digital Transformation Agency Policy for responsible use of Ai in government and the National framework for the assurance of AI in government. In addition, DHA will classify AI use according to [DTA's Classification System](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/resources/use-classification). DHA will maintain robust oversight of all AI systems, ensuring that there is a clear line of accountability and decisions made by AI. Risk based monitoring and reporting will be applied to DHA’s AI applications. 

### 6\. Stakeholder Engagement and Feedback

DHA recognises the importance of ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders, including defence personnel, their families, and the wider community. DHA will provide accessible channels for feedback on the use of AI technologies and will take appropriate action to address concerns or suggestions.  

### 7\. Continuous Improvement

We are committed to continually improving our AI practices by investing in new technologies, training, and partnerships. DHA will adapt to emerging trends and best practices in AI to ensure our systems remain transparent, effective, and aligned with our strategic objectives.  

By following these principles, Defence Housing Australia will ensure that AI technologies are used responsibly and transparently, fostering trust and accountability with all stakeholders.
