#  Artificial Intelligence (AI) transparency statement

DFAT is investigating how AI can be used to enhance secure business outcomes. Embracing opportunities, while acknowledging the uncertainties and risks of new technologies, DFAT has adopted the Digital Transformation Agency's (DTA) [Policy for the responsible use of AI in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy).

The DTA's Policy for the responsible use of AI in government establishes mandatory requirements relating to identifying [accountable officials](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/accountable-officials) and publicly publishing DFAT's AI uses in [AI transparency statements](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/transparency-statements). This statement explains how DFAT is adhering to policy requirements.

Safe, secure, and responsible use of AI is a guiding principle for AI use in DFAT.

## Approach to using AI

**Public access**. Currently, the public are not provided access to any DFAT AI tools or the ability to contribute to outputs.

**Departmental use**. DFAT's internal use of AI is based on policy and guidelines developed by DTA, Department of Industry, Science and Resources, CSIRO, and international best practice.

DFAT is part of the Whole of Australian Government Copilot trial.

DFAT is reviewing the use of AI across service delivery, scientific, and corporate and enabling domains for relevant areas for insights into automating processes and identifying efficiencies.

All staff are required to undertake training on the appropriate use of AI prior to enabling their access. General queries or concerns are encouraged to be reported through a dedicated internal channel.

## AI safety and governance

DFAT has internal governance, policy and instructions to ensure:

  * AI is implemented safely and responsibly
  * monitoring of effectiveness of AI
  * legal and regulatory compliance
  * identification of any negative impacts of AI
  * measures to mitigate potential harm from AI.

This transparency statement will be updated as DFAT's approach to AI changes.

## Accountable officials

DFAT has identified relevant personnel to be accountable for DFAT.
