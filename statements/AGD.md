## Introduction

We are trialling the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as part of the Australian Government’s commitment to harness analytical tools and techniques to:

  * predict service needs
  * improve user experience
  * support evidence-based decisions
  * gain efficiencies in agency operations.

We are committed to ensuring the way we develop, deploy and use AI systems is transparent, accountable and fair. 

This transparency statement explains the AI systems we use, how they function, and the data they rely on. This aligns with the Australian Government’s [_Policy for the responsible use of AI in government_](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy) and the requirements for AI transparency. It is also part of our ongoing commitment to safe and responsible use of AI and innovation.

## Scope and applications

The AI technologies we use include:

  * generative AI
  * machine learning
  * natural language processing
  * speech recognition
  * chatbots
  * computer vision.

We apply these technologies to:

  * automate routine administrative tasks
  * assist with drafting routine, internal and non-sensitive communications
  * automate document classification
  * analyse sentiment to understand patterns and trends in large data sets
  * categorise documents using predictive analytics.

## Data privacy and security

Protecting the privacy and security of personal, sensitive and classified information is of paramount importance to us. We ensure that any data used in AI systems is handled in accordance with the [_Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth)](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A03712/latest/text), the [_Protective Security Policy Framework_](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/) and other relevant data protection laws. Personal information is only collected, used, and shared where necessary, and in ways that comply with our [privacy policy](https://www.ag.gov.au/about-us/accountability-and-reporting/privacy-policy "Privacy policy").

## AI governance and oversight

We have developed guidance material and implemented rigorous governance processes to monitor and oversee the use of AI within the department. This includes:

  * appointing accountable officials in line with the _Policy for the responsible use of AI in government_
  * ensuring governance bodies have oversight of all AI projects within the department
  * developing policies guiding staff use of AI and information technology systems
  * making AI training available to all staff
  * implementing our Data Governance Framework and Data Strategy, which serve as the foundation for managing and leveraging data effectively within the department
  * maintaining user accreditation under _the Data Availability and Transparency Act 2022_
  * implementing the Commonwealth’s AI Assurance Framework.

## Usage patterns and domains

The following section shows how we classify our AI use and the domains in which we apply it, in keeping with the [Classification system for AI use](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/resources/use-classification) under the _Policy for the responsible use of AI in government._

### Usage patterns

The following usage patterns describe our use of AI:

  * analytics for insights
  * workplace productivity
  * image processing.

### Domains

We apply AI tools across the department in the following domains:

  * service delivery
  * compliance and fraud detection
  * policy and legal
  * corporate and enabling services.

## Continuous improvement

As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, we regularly review and update our AI policies and practices. This includes staying informed about new developments in AI technology, ethics, and regulatory requirements. We strive to improve the transparency, fairness, and effectiveness of our AI systems through continuous learning and adaptation.

We will review this statement annually, when we make a significant change to our approach to AI, or when new factors impact this statement.

## Contact information

We are committed to engaging with stakeholders and providing opportunities for feedback on our use of AI systems.
