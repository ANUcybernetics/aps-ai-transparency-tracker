The Commission’s AI transparency 
statement 
The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (Commission) uses artificial intelligence (AI) safely, 
responsibly and ethically. We comply with the Digital Transformation Agency’s (DTA) standards on 
the use of AI by Australian Public Service employees. The DTA is the AI whole of Australian 
Government coordinator. Their AI standards include: 
• Policy for the responsible use of AI in government 
• Standard for accountable officials 
• Standard for AI transparency statements 
• Interim guidance on government use of public generative AI tools 
• Australia’s AI Ethics Principles. 
Why we use AI 
We are committed to improving the quality and efficiency of our services by introducing AI in a 
responsible and safe way. We are looking into AI opportunities to support our work in protecting 
the safety, health and wellbeing of people receiving aged care. We want to benefit from the 
technology it provides. But we will also manage its risks. 
How we use AI 
At the moment we have limited use of AI, and no use of automated decision-making. In line with 
the DTA’s classification system, how we use AI (our usage patterns) and the areas that we use it in 
(domains) include: 
• usage patterns: 
o running analytics for insights 
o improving workplace productivity by automating everyday tasks 
• domains: 
o compliance 
o corporate and enabling 
o service delivery.

Public interaction and impact 
We do not use AI applications that affect the public or to interact with them. We will update this 
transparency statement if this changes. 
When AI is used more widely, we will identify any negative effects from using it, and protect the 
public and people receiving aged care. We will continue to work with AI in a responsible way and be 
open and honest about it. 
Making sure we use AI safely and responsibly 
• We make sure that AI projects are consistent with our values and are in the best interests of 
the public. This includes people receiving aged care. 
• We apply DTA policies and use AI in line with legislation, regulations, frameworks, policies 
and best practice. 
We are developing an AI strategy which will define how we use AI alongside data governance, data 
privacy and cybersecurity compliance. It will also follow our Regulatory Strategy and Corporate 
Plan. We will use whole of Australian Government policies and develop other policies and processes 
specific to the Commission. This will support us to: 
• maintain strong governance frameworks 
• protect against negative impacts 
• make sure AI systems are effective. 
Our policies apply to all employees including contractors and consultants. We will also develop and 
educate all staff with AI basics resources. 
We will update this transparency statement at least once a year, or as we develop and change how 
we use AI, our policies and technology. 
Accountable official 
The Commission’s Chief Digital Officer is appointed as the AI Accountable Official.
