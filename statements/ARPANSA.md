title: ARPANSA's artificial intelligence transparency statement | ARPANSA
---

This statement outlines our approach to the ongoing assessment, adoption and use of AI technologies at ARPANSA. It follows the Australian Government's Digital Transformation Agency's [policy for the responsible AI use in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai?utm_source=dta.gov.au&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=AI%20policy%20launch). 

We recognise AI's potential to boost workplace productivity and pledge to use it safely and responsibly.

When considering AI, we apply the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) definition:

> An AI system is a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments. Different AI systems vary in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment.

## Introduction

ARPANSA is committed to the protection of Australia, the health and safety of its people, and the environment from the harmful effects of radiation. Delivering on our role includes the responsible, ethical, and transparent use of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance our research, services and operations.

The agency recognises this is a rapidly evolving technology; this statement covers our approach and consideration of AI and how we will go about ensuring its safe and responsible use. We are committed to adapting our use and capabilities as the technology, environment and policy requirements evolve.

## Purpose of AI use

AI may be used across various corporate and enabling functions to enhance workplace productivity by streamlining workflows, automating routine tasks, providing analytics and intelligent data insights. It is used by select staff in their routine digital daily activities and to provide accessibility support.

AI may also be used to support service delivery in relation to compliance and assurance.

### Workplace productivity

We see the potential benefits in using AI to improve workplace productivity for all staff including:

  * streamlining staff accessibility and understanding of policies and entitlements
  * improving accessibility to assist staff in using platforms, applications, and services
  * improving the uptake of features in existing products and services
  * providing specialised just in time education for staff
  * assisting in summarising content such as documents, emails and other content 
  * enabling the transcription and dynamic review of interviews and meeting notes
  * supporting rapid prototyping of training and education materials for agency staff.

### Public interaction

ARPANSA’s use of AI does not involve direct interaction with the public or pose any significant impact to individuals. AI is not used as part of automated decision making with respect to individuals and the agency commits to being clear if AI becomes part of a decision-making process.

## Monitoring and governance

### Responsible AI usage policy

The agency will maintain an internal responsible AI usage policy that aligns with advice and guidance provided by the DTA, Australian Public Service Commission and other relevant agencies for using AI services responsibly.

### Measure and monitoring

#### Training

The agency will provide all staff with training and education in general AI knowledge and where relevant to specific AI tools as well as on-demand support. Staff complete mandatory training when accessing AI tools and have continued access to training on the proper use of AI services.

#### Support

The agency will provide internal support and information for staff and managers on the use of AI. All Staff are provided the means to report concerns or queries to the Digital Technology Team through the provision of feedback session, surveys, and service requests.

#### Monitoring

The agency acknowledges AI carries with it emerging risks and will continue to establish oversight and governance frameworks and processes to monitor the effectiveness, risk and ethical use of our AI systems. 

## Compliance

Our AI practices will comply with the mandatory requirements of the Australian Government's Policy for the Responsible Use of AI in Government. We ensure that our AI systems are in accordance with all applicable laws and guidelines. This includes regular reviews and audits to maintain compliance with relevant legislation and regulations, and continuous improvement processes.

### Accountable official

ARPANSA's Chief Information Officer was designated as the accountable official for AI on 11 November 2024.

### AI transparency statement

The AI transparency statement was first published to our website on 14 February 2025.
