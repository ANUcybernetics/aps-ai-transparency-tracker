#  Artificial Intelligence (AI) transparency statement 

TEQSA acknowledges the Digital Transformation Agency’s [_Policy for the responsible use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in government_](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy) that sets the approach for the use of AI by government.

## How TEQSA uses AI

TEQSA participated in a short Microsoft Copilot trial in 2024, which has now concluded.

TEQSA uses MS productivity tools’ limited AI capabilities but has not authorised the use of AI in service delivery including our regulatory function or decision-making processes.

## Training and assistance

All TEQSA staff will be required to undertake the DTA’s AI fundamentals training modules to raise awareness and develop basic understanding of AI.

## Accountable officials

The Chief Information Officer is designated as the accountable official for TEQSA. An AI Steering Committee will be established to develop an overarching agency approach to AI and assess the opportunities and risks in using AI within the agency.

## Statement review and updates

This AI transparency statement was first published in March 2025. This statement will be reviewed annually, or when significant change is made to our approach to AI.
