# Corporate information and governance

One of our obligations as an Australian Government agency is to provide information about how we operate and perform.

We strive to be efficient and accountable in how we fulfil our role as Australia’s financial intelligence unit and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) regulator. 

The information and documents we provide demonstrate how we achieve this and how you can request more information from us.

This guidance sets out how we interpret the Act, along with associated Rules and regulations. Australian courts are ultimately responsible for interpreting these laws and determining if any provisions of these laws are contravened. 

The examples and scenarios in this guidance are meant to help explain our interpretation of these laws. They’re not exhaustive or meant to cover every possible scenario.

This guidance provides general information and isn't a substitute for legal advice. This guidance avoids legal language wherever possible and it might include generalisations about the application of the law. Some provisions of the law referred to have exceptions or important qualifications. In most cases your particular circumstances must be taken into account when determining how the law applies to you.
