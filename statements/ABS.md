In accordance with the [Policy for responsible use of AI in government](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/responsible-use-of-AI-in-government) this statement outlines how the ABS uses artificial intelligence (AI), how AI related risks are being managed and how we comply with legislation and policy.

## AI use

As Australia’s national statistical agency, we use AI related technologies to enhance our operations to meet the needs of our data users and providers, the government and the Australian people. 

We use AI to improve our productivity by supporting and automating business functions, including:

  * using machine learning to apply standard classifications to data, and
  * using a generative AI chatbot as part of the [Census Test](https://info.census.abs.gov.au/about/census-test). The chatbot is available on the Census website.
  * using generative AI in the development and review of written content, such as summarising documents and transcribing meeting notes.

## Public interaction and impact

The public will have the opportunity to use a generative AI chatbot to obtain information about the Census Test in August 2025.

The public do not have direct interaction with any other systems that utilise AI technologies and will not be impacted by our use of AI.

## AI governance

We have established governance processes and forums to assess and review potential business uses of AI. These arrangements ensure AI is implemented safely and responsibly in accordance with government policy and ethics principles. Ensuring data and cyber security is critical for us, and these aspects are essential in our consideration of AI technologies. We will monitor the effectiveness of AI technologies by capturing performance metrics, investigating user reported anomalies and conducting periodic system reviews.

## AI risks and safety

We are aware of potential risks and take a risk-managed approach to the adoption of AI, particularly for public facing systems. 

We use forms of AI which are transparent and traceable, presenting lower potential risks and our AI governance ensures business uses are appropriately mitigating and managing risks.

## Compliance

We only utilise AI services in accordance with applicable legislation, regulations, frameworks and policies.

We comply with the Policy for responsible use of AI in government and have:

  * designated policy implementation to an accountable official,
  * made this publicly available statement outlining our approach to AI adoption and use, and
  * provided AI fundamentals training to staff.

This transparency statement was published to our website on 16th July 2025, and will be updated every 12 months or as our approach to AI changes.
