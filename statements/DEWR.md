#  DEWR AI Transparency Statement 

The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations is engaging with artificial intelligence (AI) in a way that prioritises human rights, the protection of personal information, and respecting Indigenous data, while keeping humans at the centre of our decision-making. Our intent is to leverage AI to drive innovation, improve operational efficiency, and support the broader goal of enabling people to have safe, secure, and well-paid work with the skills for a sustainable future.

## On this page:

We are committed to ensuring that AI enhances the effectiveness and quality of our services while maintaining the highest standards of ethics, safety, lawfulness, and public trust. DEWR use of AI is transparent, responsible, and aligned with legislative and regulatory requirements, including the [Policy for the Responsible Use of AI in Government](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy) and the [Voluntary AI Safety Standard](https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/voluntary-ai-safety-standard).

As defined in the Policy for Responsible Use of AI in Government, an AI system is a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments. Different AI systems vary in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment.

Automated systems are different, and range from:

  * traditional rules-based systems (for example a system which calculates a rate of payment in accordance with a formula set out in legislation)
  * to more specialised systems which use automated tools to predict and deliberate, including through the use of machine learning.

## Monitoring and Accountability

DEWR’s AI initiatives are overseen by the AI Accountable Officer, who also serves as the department’s Chief Data Officer. This role ensures robust monitoring and evaluation of AI systems to maintain effectiveness, fairness, and compliance with government policies and the law. DEWR is committed to adapting AI systems as needed to align with evolving legislation, ethical standards, and public expectations.  
  
To support these efforts, DEWR has established a robust governance framework to ensure the ethical, transparent, and secure use of AI. Key elements include:

  * AI Governance: The department’s AI Adoption Committee oversees all AI initiatives, ensuring they align with DEWR’s strategic objectives and government standards.
  * Ethical Principles: AI development and deployment adhere to DEWR’s Ethics Framework and whole-of-government AI guidelines, embedding considerations like privacy, safety, lawfulness and fairness from the outset.
  * Human Oversight: Human-in-the-loop (HITL) mechanisms are embedded at critical stages to ensure accountability and accuracy in AI outputs.
  * Cybersecurity Standards: DEWR is committed to applying the cybersecurity requirements outlined in the Australian Government Information Security Manual (ISM) and the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF), using a risk-based approach, to ensure the secure operation of all AI applications.

## How We Use AI

DEWR uses AI to enhance workplace productivity and support corporate and enabling functions. These applications focus on streamlining internal processes and automating routine tasks. As part of its commitment to responsible AI use, DEWR is participating in the Pilot Australian Government AI Assurance Framework to explore how AI can further optimise internal operations while adhering to ethical and governance standards.

## Usage Patterns

DEWR employs AI in the following way:

  * Workplace Productivity: Use tools like automated document summarisation and virtual assistants to streamline workflows and improve efficiency.
  * Analytics for Insights: Used to identify, produce or understand insights within structured or unstructured materials via comprehensive data analysis.

DEWR does not currently use AI in service delivery or in how we administer programs delivered to the Australian public. Specifically, AI is not used in compliance, auditing, or decision-making processes.

## Domains

Our AI applications focus on supporting corporate functions, including HR, finance, media and communications, and IT, by automating processes, optimising resource allocation and improving operational efficiency.

## Ensuring Responsible Use

DEWR safeguards against risks and ensures responsible AI use through releasing an annual AI Transparency Statement to provide visibility on how AI is used and managed.
