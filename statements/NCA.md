---

The Digital Transformation Agency's [Policy for responsible use of AI in government](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/responsible-use-of-AI-in-government) sets out the Australian Government approach to embrace the opportunities of AI and provide for safe and responsible use of AI. 

The National Capital Authority (NCA) is committed to identifying ethical, responsible and meaningful use when considering the adoption of AI capabilities. We will be transparent as we explore, adopt and integrate AI technology to benefit staff and external stakeholders.

Currently, the NCA does not use AI in any services we provide however we recognise the increasing use of AI and the benefits it could afford.   
If the NCA implements any AI capability, this statement will be updated to outline our use including:

  * the intentions behind why the NCA is using AI or is considering its adoption
  * [classification](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/resources/use-classification) of AI use according to usage patterns and domains
  * [classification](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/resources/use-classification) of use where the public may directly interact with, or be significantly impacted by, AI without a human intermediary or intervention
  * measures to monitor the effectiveness of deployed AI systems, such as governance or processes
  * compliance with applicable legislation and regulation
  * efforts to identify and protect the public against negative impacts
  * compliance with each requirement under the [Policy for responsible use of AI in government](https://architecture.digital.gov.au/responsible-use-of-AI-in-government) _._

**Accountable official**

The Chief Information Officer is designated as the NCA’s accountable official.

**AI transparency statement**

This AI transparency statement was first published to our website in February 2025. This statement will be reviewed annually, or when we make any significant change to our approach to AI, as outlined above.

Should the NCA approve the use of AI, this statement will be updated to include measures to monitor effectiveness of deployed AI systems and efforts to protect the public against negative impacts.
