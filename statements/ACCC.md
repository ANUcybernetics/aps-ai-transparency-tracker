## How we intend to use AI

The ACCC sees the opportunity to use artificial intelligence (AI) in a safe and responsible way. We believe it can contribute to the effective and efficient delivery of our objectives for the Australian community, over time.

In considering AI, we have adopted the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) [definition of AI](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/explanatory-memorandum-on-the-updated-oecd-definition-of-an-ai-system_623da898-en.html):

  * An AI system is a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments. Different AI systems vary in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment.

We are committed to building our AI capabilities and exploring our use of AI to support the ACCC’s functions in a safe and responsible manner. Humans will be at the centre of all oversight and decision making. When engaging with AI, we will always honour our commitments to the public, businesses, government and the courts, including with respect to security, privacy, confidentiality, ethics and other legal obligations. We will make risk-based decisions on its use.

We will seek opportunities to:

  * cultivate expertise within the agency to understand the impacts of AI across our regulatory remits
  * inform our identification of threats and harms in markets that we regulate more quickly and accurately
  * enhance our ability to undertake analytics and generate insights
  * improve workplace productivity including through reducing manual processes.

## How we are using AI

The ACCC usage patterns are: 

### Analytics for insights

The ACCC uses AI to produce insights from structured and unstructured materials in the following ways:

  * assisting with reviewing and interrogating large and complex sets of documents or datasets
  * enhancing pattern detection by predicting and identifying potentially concerning behaviour.

### Workplace productivity

The ACCC’s use of AI is aimed at improving workplace productivity for staff. This includes:

  * summarising documents, emails, and other content
  * transcribing interviews and meeting notes
  * creating training material for staff
  * assisting staff in efficiently retrieving information.

## Areas of AI application

The domains used for AI applications focuses on the following areas:

  * **corporate and enabling** \- to support functions by automating processes, optimising resource allocation and improving operational efficiency.
  * **compliance and fraud detection** \- to assist with identifying patterns the identification of patterns in records to help comply with laws and regulations.
  * **scientific** \- to enhance the processing of complex datasets, to predict outcomes and to enhance monitoring functions.

## Public interaction and impact

We do not currently deploy AI as part of the ACCC’s direct interaction with the public, including the Infocentre and ScamWatch.

For all internal uses of AI, our processes make sure that we consider any potential impacts on the public, including businesses. While AI may be used to assist in various tasks, oversight and decision making remains in human hands.

## Governance and compliance

### Monitoring AI systems

We have taken the following steps to monitor the effectiveness of deployed AI systems, and to meet all mandatory requirements of the [Policy for responsible use of AI in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy) by:

  * designating accountability for implementing this policy to an accountable official, the ACCC’s General Manager of Data and Intelligence
  * adopting an AI policy and procedure that reflects the policy and includes an established AI review and approval pathway for internal use of AI. This includes supporting infrastructure such as an AI register
  * standing up an internal working group that provides internal governance on the use of AI
  * considering the potential risks of AI as part of our internal risk management
  * introducing training (supported by internally developed resources) for all ACCC staff regarding the use of AI
  * the publication of this transparency statement.

### Review of this statement

This statement was published in **February 2025**. It will be reviewed and updated:

  * at least once a year
  * when a significant change is made to the agency’s approach to AI
  * when the ACCC becomes aware of any new factor that materially impacts the statement’s accuracy.
